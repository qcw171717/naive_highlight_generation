      "I’m Susan Schaller and where do you want me to start?\n",
      "Her story starts; actually it starts kind of abruptly\n",
      "I was indeed riding a bicycle to high school\n",
      "And a catering truck hit me and I was put in the hospital with a concussion\n",
      "I was seventeen years old\n",
      "And the concussion is bad enough that it slowed my brain enough that I couldn't read\n",
      "And so naturally I couldn't go to school\n",
      "Which sucked for her\n",
      "At seventeen I was very much a nerd and I was bored out of my mind\n",
      "So imagine Susan sitting there in the hospital\n",
      "One day one of her friends…\n",
      "A friend of mine who was just a little older and had graduated the semester before me suggested going to the nearby university and crashing classes—\n",
      "Now wait a second why would you go—if your brain was working slowly why wouldn’t you go swimming?\n",
      "Well I couldn’t read but I could listen and I could hear and the person was saying “oh it’s a lot better than high school\n",
      "So one day she was at this college\n",
      "Just kind of wandering down a random hallway\n",
      "And I opened the first door on the left\n",
      "That was the accident that changed my whole life; just picking that door\n",
      "At the front of the room there was this older guy\n",
      "He was thin he was bald and he was tracing shapes in the air with his hands\n",
      "It was as if there were pictures being painted in the air and then they immediately disappeared\n",
      "Then another picture appeared\n",
      "I was mesmerized\n",
      "Wow\n",
      "The professor was signing\n",
      "This class was actually one of the first classes to teach sign at a regular hearing university, ever\n",
      "I had also walked into history but didn't know it\n",
      "Fast forward five years Susan now is fluent in sign\n",
      "She moves to Los Angeles\n",
      "It's the late 1970s\n",
      "And I was snatched and put into interpreter training programs because at that time they were very, very few interpreters\n",
      "And I found myself in a classroom\n",
      "In a community college\n",
      "In something called a reading skills class\n",
      "So she walks into the class\n",
      "She sees kids all over the classroom making big excited gestures one to the other\n",
      "And at the door I saw this man holding himself\n",
      "Kind of off by himself\n",
      "Making his own straitjacket\n",
      "She went over to the instructor and she pointed at the guy and she said, “Who, who's that guy over there\n",
      "” And the instructor said, “Well, he was born deaf\n",
      "His uncle, he has this kind of insistent uncle who, who brings him here every day\n",
      "We, we don't know exactly what to do with him though\n",
      "What did this guy look like?\n",
      "He was a beautiful, um, well now I know, I don't know if I would have had that in my head at the time, beautiful looking Mayan\n",
      "You know, high cheekbones and black hair, black eyes\n",
      "And something about his eyes caught her attention\n",
      "He was studying mouths and I walked up to him and said, “Hello my name is Susan\n",
      "And this is where things start to get a little weird\n",
      "He looks at her\n",
      "And instead of signing his name whatever it was\n",
      "He brings up his hands…\n",
      "Signs right back to her,\n",
      "“Hello my name is Susan\n",
      "Susan like shakes her head and says, “No, no, I'm Susan\n",
      "And he responds, “No, no I'm Susan\n",
      "Everything you said, he tried to say\n",
      "Exactly\n",
      "I call it a visual echolalia\n",
      "And I remember thinking—\n",
      "Why is he doing this?\n",
      "I mean Susan did he, did he look like he had some kind of disability or condition\n",
      "He was uh, he was intelligent\n",
      "I wouldn't have been able to answer if you asked me “how can you see intelligence?”  But you can actually see intelligence in people's eyes\n",
      "He was just missing something\n",
      "To copy me meant that he didn't really know what I was doing\n",
      "And that's when it occurred to her\n",
      "This man doesn’t have language\n",
      "Wait how old was this guy?\n",
      "He was 27 years old\n",
      "And in all that time no one had taught him sign language or anything?\n",
      "Well he didn’t know he was deaf\n",
      "He was born deaf\n",
      "He didn't know there was sound\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "27 years no idea that there was sound\n",
      "He could see the mouth moving\n",
      "He could see people responding\n",
      "He thought we figured all this stuff out visually\n",
      "And he thought, “I must be stupid\n",
      "And so here's the question for our hour\n",
      "This is Radiolab\n",
      "I’m Jad Abumrad\n",
      "I’m Robert Krulwich\n",
      "Words\n",

      "Can you dream without them? Can you…\n",
      "That’s enough\n",
      "Can you swim without them?\n",
      "No, no, that’s enough\n",
      "Alright, back to the story\n",
      "So this man that Susan met, we don't actually know his real name but when she wrote about him in her book, A Man without Words, she called him Ildefonso\n",
      "There they are sitting in the classroom\n",
      "She's right there with him\n",
      "Of course she's wondering—\n",
      "What have you've been doing for 27 years?! (Laughing\n",
      "So she thinks well let me see if I can teach him some just basic sign language\n",
      "In an interesting case she takes out a book and makes the sign book\n",
      "But the sign for book looks like opening up a book\n",
      "So he thought I was ordering him to open a book\n",
      "So he grabs the book and he opens it\n",
      "Cuz he thought I was asking him to do something\n",
      "It was very difficult\n",
      "If I gave him the sign for standing up he thought I wanted him to stand up\n",
      "And so I couldn't, I couldn't have a conversation with him\n",
      "And it was the most frustrating thing I have ever done in my life\n",
      "Wait a second, how long did this go on for?\n",
      "Well uh weeks, it was weeks\n",
      "Wow\n",
      "Often times when we said goodbye or just left, (we couldn’t really say goodbye), I really believed that we wouldn't see each other again and I was often times very surprised when he would be sitting there at the table\n",
      "And I think sometimes he looked surprised that I showed up\n",
      "But after a couple of weeks of him—\n",
      "Constantly miming, copying me\n",
      "She had an idea\n",
      "Perhaps it's just possible that if I, if I died tomorrow I would have had only one really, really good thought in my life\n",
      "I'm going to ignore him\n",
      "(Music\n",
      "I taught an invisible student\n",
      "I stopped talking to him and I stopped having eye contact\n",
      "And I set up an empty chair\n",
      "And then she says she would hold up to this empty chair a picture of a cat\n",
      "and I was trying to explain to this invisible student that this creature, a cat—so I'd be miming a cat and petting a cat—and then I’d sign the sign for cat\n",
      "Then she would hop to the other seat, the invisible student’s seat, and pretend to get it\n",
      "\"Oh I know,” you know with my facial expression, “Oh, I get it!”\n",
      "So you're playing all the parts\n",
      "You're both the teacher and the invisible student\n",
      "That’s right, that’s right\n",
      "Wow\n",
      "Doing all these crazy things and he’d just watch me\n",
      "He stopped copying her which was good…\n",
      "But\n",
      "I’d do this over and over and over for days and days and days…\n",
      "And she says he just didn't get it\n",
      "He looked bored a lot of times\n",
      "But one day in the middle of one of these endless pretend student exercises…\n",
      "Something happened\n",
      "Out of the corner of her eye, she sees him shift his body\n",
      "And he looked—It's interesting how his body was upright and he looked like something was about to happen\n",
      "(Music\n",
      "He looked around the room—this is a 27 year old man— and he looks around the room as if he had just landed from Mars and it was the first time he had ever saw anything\n",
      "Something was about to happen\n",
      "His eyes grew wider, she says, and then wider\n",
      "And then—\n",
      "He slaps his hands on the table\n",
